# Project Title

Refactor Challenge

## Desceiption

To refactor a website for a marketing agency named Horiseon to follow accessibility standards.

## What I did

To achieve the following task of making the codebase more accessible, I cleaned the code by adding semantics that allow it to be easily read.
Mainly by making the header, main body and footer clearer distinction in what they do For example sections were added throughout the code to seperate snippets of code for clearer distinction and functionality such as nav and aside were clearly seperated.
In addition to all this alts were given to all images and a title was given.
